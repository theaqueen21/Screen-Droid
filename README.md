># Known Issues

We are aware of the following issues with our app:

- Slow Startup
- A bug preventing the device's name from disappearing from the list box when running a task. This allows multiple tasks to be ran on the same device, which may result in unexpected errors.
- Low Quality UI and Old Design
- If our app is ended incorrectly due to any system or user error, the lock file `AppData\Local\Temp\ADBV2.lock` might not get deleted, which will prevent the program from launching unless it is deleted manually.

># Upcoming Features

We have a number of exciting features in the pipeline for our app. Here's a sneak peek at what you can expect:

- **File Transfer**: Our app will allow you to easily download and upload files, both over wired and wireless connections.
